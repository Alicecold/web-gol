# web-gol
A web version of the earlier Game of life project at newton.

## Game of life
John Conway's Game of life (or GoL) is a simple simulation of a collection of bits on a "infinite" plane which uses some rules for when each bit will "die", "live" or "be born". You can read more about it on wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Life).

## dotnet version
The dotnet/c#-version is located in the sexytemplate folder (Why is it called that? Good question. Maybe we can tell you that over an cup of tea?), and is what was originally created for the YAPP-WEB course on newton

## Pure js/localstorage version
In the docs folder exists the non-dotnet version, which Alice ported later in order to be able to publish it properly via github pages. Instead of postgresql on a server thats down and instead of a bulky dotnet template it uses local storage which exists in most modern browsers.

Even if you do not have a browser with localStorage functionality, you can still use the Game Of Life - it's only for the database.
